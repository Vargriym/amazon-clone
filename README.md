## How I worked on this project

The goal was to build a fully functional e-commerce site similar to Amazon. I took an iterative approach with 2 main phases:

Planning:

- Researched Amazon's key features and flows
- Created user stories and component mapping

Design:

- Created UI mockups and page templates
- Designed responsive components
- Defined Redux store structure


## Introduction

This project aims to replicate the core functionalities and user experience of the original Amazon website. Through the
utilization of React, I successfully constructed a responsive and dynamic user interface that mimics the seamless
navigation and interactivity of the real platform.
